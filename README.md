# TaskPilot: A Modern Project Management App

TaskPilot is a modern, offline-first project management application designed to help individuals and small teams manage their work efficiently. It provides a clean, intuitive interface for creating projects, tracking tasks and subtasks, and visualizing progress.

This app is ideal for individuals who need to manage a complex workload without the overhead of larger, team-focused platforms. Because it runs entirely on your local machine, it's a perfect solution for use in secure, isolated, or offline systems where data privacy and availability are critical.

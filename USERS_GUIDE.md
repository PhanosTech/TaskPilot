# TaskPilot: User Guide

Welcome to TaskPilot! This guide will walk you through the core features of the application.

## 1. Dashboard

The Dashboard is your central hub. It provides a quick overview of your work.

-   **Summary Cards**: At the top, you'll find key metrics: Total Projects, Tasks In Progress, and Overdue Tasks.
-   **Tasks Overview**: A pie chart showing the distribution of all your tasks by their status.
-   **Active Work Queue**: This is a list of all tasks from "In Progress" projects that are currently "To Do" or "In Progress".
    -   **Single-click** a task to open the detail view and edit it.
    -   **Double-click** a task to navigate directly to its parent project's page.
-   **Personal Todos**: A simple checklist for your personal reminders that aren't tied to a specific project. You can add, edit, delete, and move items between "In Progress" and "Backlog".

## 2. Projects

The Projects page lists all your projects, grouped by status.

-   **Create a Project**: Click the "Create Project" button to open a dialog where you can enter a name and description.
-   **View a Project**: Click on any project card to navigate to its detail page.
-   **Show/Hide Archived**: Use the "Show Archived" switch to toggle the visibility of projects you've archived.

### Project Detail Page

This is where you manage a specific project.

-   **Tasks Tab**: View all tasks associated with the project. Click the "Add Task" button to create a new one. Click any task in the table to open its detail view.

## 3. Kanban Board

The Kanban Board provides a visual way to manage tasks for all of your **In Progress** projects.

-   **Filter by Project**: Use the dropdown at the top to view tasks for a specific project or all active projects.

-   **Add a Task**: Click the "Add Task" button at the bottom of any column to create a new task with that status.

## 4. Reports

The Reports page allows you to view and export a history of your work logs.

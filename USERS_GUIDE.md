# TaskPilot: User Guide

Welcome to TaskPilot! This guide will walk you through the core features of the application.

## 1. Dashboard

The Dashboard is your central hub. It provides a quick overview of your work.

-   **Summary Cards**: At the top, you'll find key metrics: Total Projects, Tasks In Progress, and Overdue Tasks.
-   **Tasks Overview**: A pie chart showing the distribution of all your tasks by their status.
-   **Active Work Queue**: This is a list of all tasks from "In Progress" projects that are currently "To Do" or "In Progress".
    -   **Single-click** a task to open the detail view and edit it.
    -   **Double-click** a task to navigate directly to its parent project's page.
-   **Personal Todos**: A focused list for your current personal work. Add items inline, reorder them, and send anything back to the backlog when priorities change.
-   **Quick Link to Backlog**: Use the link beneath the personal todo card to jump straight into the full backlog management page.

## 2. Projects

The Projects page lists all your projects, grouped by status.

-   **Create a Project**: Click the "Create Project" button to open a dialog where you can enter a name and description.
-   **View a Project**: Click on any project card to navigate to its detail page.
-   **Show/Hide Archived**: Use the "Show Archived" switch to toggle the visibility of projects you've archived.

### Project Detail Page

This is where you manage a specific project.

-   **Change Status**: Use the dropdown menu at the top right to change the project's status (e.g., from "In Progress" to "Done" or "Archived").
-   **Edit Project**: Click the pencil icon to edit the project's name and description.
-   **Tasks Tab**: View all tasks associated with the project. Click the "Add Task" button to create a new one. Click any task in the table to open its detail view. When editing a task, press `Enter` inside a subtask title to instantly create and focus a new subtask beneath itâ€”perfect for rapid entry.
-   **Notes Tab**: Manage project-specific notes. You can add new notes, edit their content using Markdown, and even embed tasks from the project directly into your notes.

## 3. Kanban Board

The Kanban Board provides a visual way to manage tasks for all of your **In Progress** projects.

-   **Filter by Project**: Use the dropdown at the top to view tasks for a specific project or all active projects.
-   **Change Task Status**: Click the three-dots menu on any task card to move it to a different column (e.g., from "To Do" to "In Progress").
-   **View Task Details**: Double-click any task card to open the detailed editor.
-   **Add a Task**: Click the "Add Task" button at the bottom of any column to create a new task with that status. Inside the task editor you can press `Enter` in any subtask row to create and jump into the next one without touching the mouse.

## 4. Todo Backlog

The Todo Backlog page lets you manage all personal todos in one place.

-   **Categorize Todos**: Create custom categories (e.g., Work, School, Errands) with distinct colors to keep long lists organized.
-   **Bulk Capture**: Add multiple backlog items quickly by typing a title and hitting `Enter`; items remain grouped under their category.
-   **Promote to Active**: Click the play icon on any backlog item to move it into your dashboard's active list. Those items can then be reordered and focused on from the main dashboard.
-   **Edit & Prune**: Rename categories, change their colors, and delete completed or obsolete items at any time.

## 5. Reports

The Reports page allows you to view and export a history of your work logs.

-   **Filter Logs**: Use the project and date range filters to narrow down the logs you want to see.
-   **Export Logs**: Click the "Export" button to generate a formatted text summary of the filtered logs, which you can easily copy and paste.

## 6. Theme

You can switch between light and dark themes using the sun/moon icon in the top-right corner of the application header.
